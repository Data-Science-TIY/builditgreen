The fundamental change to LEED 2009 was the revised credit ratings to reflect significant technological advancements in the industry. Also, Regional Priority (RP) extra points were added. Projects can earn up to 10 bonus points for credits based on location (e.g. in dry a climate reducing water consumption is worth an additional point) and Innovation and Design. Different regions of the country recognize different credits as extra points. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Under LEED 2009, there are 100 possible base points distributed across six credit categories: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Innovation in Design. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h4>LEED versions 2.1 and 2.2</h4>\n        <p>\n        The major difference between LEED 2.1 and 2.2 is the Energy and Atmosphere, Credit 2.
