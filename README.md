Welcome to Build It Green, the website for understanding trends in LEED scoring and usage!

At Build It Green we are interested in showing the trends in LEED usage by builders and developers.  How are they using the certification system?  What
certifications are most popular?  Which certification points are hardest to achieve?

At Build It Green we have an in depth analysis of over 7000 LEED New Construction projects, point by point.  As far as we know it is the first of it's kind.

Check back with us via our blog as we track our progress before launch.
