        New York City is the first city to mandate the release of energy use data for commercial and residential buildings.  Our study matched LEED buildings to NYC block and lot numbers using New Yorkâ€™s Geoclient API and hand checked to assure that matches were correct. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Our analysis focuses on multifamily housing space. We found twenty multifamily new construction projects certified by LEED before 2013, when the most recent energy use data is available. As more buildings are certified and recent energy usage comes online we hope to expand our analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
        Two measurements are used in our analysis - total greenhouse gas emissions and Temperature Weighted Source EUI.  Source energy represents the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the building. It incorporates all transmission, delivery, and production losses.  Total greenhouse gas aggregates different greenhouse emissions into a single measure, using global warming potentials.

            <strong>Interesting Findings:</strong> This initial view suggests that LEED buildings perform similarly on GHG emissions to similarly sized non-LEED buildings, with a similar general shape but perhaps a slightly less steep slope, indicating somewhat better performance.

            <strong>Further analysis:</strong> What scores and certifications did the New York City LEED buildings achieve?  How would commercial buildings do on a similar analysis?

            <strong>Interesting Findings:</strong> Most of these LEED buildings were scored on the 2.1 and 2.2 LEED NC versions. They averaged a LEED score of 37, with the most common score being a 33, right at the cutoff for Silver Certification. As we have seen in other analyses, the credits that are most heavily tied to building energy performance are not generally achieved until LEED status reaches Gold and Platinum.

          <strong>Interesting Findings:</strong> We then compared each building on Temperature Weighted Source EUI and direct , indirect, and total greenhouse gas emissions. Source energy represents the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the building. It incorporates all transmission, delivery, and production losses. By taking all energy use into account, the score provides a complete assessment of energy efficiency in a building.  LEED performance is uneven in this sample of NYC buildings. LEED buildings generally outperform non LEED in total greenhouse gas emissions, with 13 out of 17 doing better than their similarly sized peers.  However, they fare worse on Temperature Weighted Source EUI, with only 6 of 17 outperforming their peers.

         <strong>Further analysis:</strong> With a bigger sample, could LEED score be correlated with energy performance?  With a detailed score breakdown for each building, could we correlate energy performance to EAc1 and EAc1:
